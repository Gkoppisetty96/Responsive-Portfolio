            Geethika is a recent graduate of Emory University who decided halfway through her college career to stop studying medicine and instead go into IT, thinking that learning to code would be a better path than another eight years in school. This is the first time she's done web development since highschool, and she threw a stress ball against the wall no less than five times while coding these pages.

            When not having the time of her life coding, Geethika is most often found playing video games, watching TV, or reading. She recently spent way too much on Steam, and the game she is currently playing is Framed. Other games that she enjoys playing include Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery, I Love Hue, and Tsuki. Her current favorite tv show is the Carmen Sandiego Netflix series, and her favorite movie is Iron Man, with runner-ups of the rest of the Iron Man trilogy, followed by any other movie in the MCU.

            Other hobbies include calligraphy, photography, and cooking. She practices calligraphy in her bullet journal, which is something she uses to plan out every day and of which she is currently on her second notebook of. Her phone gallery is full of photos to be edited to go on Instagram (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/geethika.kps/">@geethika.kps</a>). She enjoys cooking and frequently experiments with new recipes, to the mixed delight of her family.
